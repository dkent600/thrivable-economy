## Hardhat

Comparing Hardhat to Remix and Foundry, Hardhat seems like an easier integration with things like Typescript, Ethers.js (or Viem), VSCode and Windows, while being at a professional level and helping to stay close to Web3.

Though it appears that Hardhat does encourage use of WSL, at least for following their tutorials.
